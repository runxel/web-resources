# Web Resources
Overview of some resources for web devs that could be helpful. I used most of them, some are just added for later reference, meaning the following oscillates somewhere between an "Awesome List" and a dumping ground (_just a joke_).

_Your mileage may vary._

---

## Basics

- [Can I Use \<feature\>…?](https://caniuse.com/) – First place to look.
- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/)



## CMS and Static Site Generators

- [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) – Fast and minimal (database-less!) CMS
- [Perch](https://grabaperch.com/)
- [TextPattern](https://textpattern.com/)
- [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) – A static site generator
- [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) – A micro web-framework for Python
- [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) – dito


## Frameworks

> Hey! I want a fullblown framework!

Sure buddy! I've got you covered. Have a look at these:

- [Foundation](https://get.foundation/) – Might be a good starting point
- [HTML5 Bones](https://www.html5bones.com/) is on the complete different end of the scale, it has the bare minimum
- [Hello, CSS!](https://github.com/arp242/hello-css) – a simple "CSS template which styles most elements to neutral and aesthetically pleasing defaults" according to its creator, Martin Tournoij
- Yes, there is _still_ the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), but I think that one is more interesting for its other features, like a `.htaccess` file, than _actually_ consuming it whole

The most used full blown **CSS** frameworks currently seem to be 
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

There are however some _classless_, micro-frameworks out there:
- [Dropin Minimal CSS](https://dohliam.github.io/dropin-minimal-css/)
- [lit](https://ajusa.github.io/lit/), which is truly _micro_
Similiar to those: [YAMB CSS](https://github.com/runxel/yamb-css) (_shameless plug_). It has:  
- dark & light theme
- even print support!
It's a great starting point, so check it out.
